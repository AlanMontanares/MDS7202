Adicionalmente el programa calcula estos outlier como aquellos que estan sobre el valor del tercer cuartil más 1.5 veces la diferencia entre el cuartil tercero con el primero (Q3 + 1.5(Q3-Q1)), y cualquier valor superior a este umbral se considera outlier, lo cual tiene sentido ya que hay valores muy por encima de este umbral. El caso analogo es para el umbral inferior en el cual solo hay 1 outlier para el examen de matematicas.

Primero se pudieron eliminar valores duplicados y luego los que estaban fuera de los margenes de puntajes o al reves. Si bien ambas entregan distintos resultados, hay una forma que es mas correcta que la otra.\n","\n","Por ejemplo, imaginese que el nombre \"pepe\" esta repetido 2 veces, y los valores se fueron registrando en orden temporal (eg. loc=1 se registro primero que loc=2). ¿Qué hubiese pasado si en el primer registro hubiese obtenido 150 puntos en un examen?, en ese caso se deberian eliminar los dos registros, debido a que el segundo no cuenta porque no se vale hacer un examen por más de una vez, y el primero se eliminaria por exceder los limites de los umbrales. En caso de que el primer registro no exceda los margenes de puntaje se conservaria solo ese registro.\n","\n","Dicho esto, lo mas adecuado seria primero eliminar los valores duplicados (ya que solo debemos conservar los primeros registros de cada uno) y luego eliminar las filas que excedan los margenes de puntajes, debido a que si lo hacemos al reves, podriamos estar dejando los resultados del segundo examen (lo cual tampoco se debe). Sin embargo, esto solo contaria si el supuesto de que los registros fueron hechos en orden temporal. Como en este caso no se especifica se podria tomar cualquier orden debido a que no hay mas informacion previa. Sin embargo, en este caso se pidio explicitamente que se dejaran las 1000 muestras, por lo que primero se eliminaron valores nan, luego los que exceden los rangos y por ultimo los duplicados.\n","\n","Respecto a estos nuevos boxplot se puede ver mayor presencia de outliers por abajo, la mediana se encuentra entre 70 y 75 puntos para todos los examenes, y las distribuciones siguen teniendo un comportamiento un poco asimetrico.\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"e8bae7dfbd70490eacb49443d1ad8613","deepnote_cell_height":193.1875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"2tnenh4uOF6k"},"source":["## 1.3 Trabajando con Datos\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/YQitE4YNQNahy/giphy-downsized-large.gif\">\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"a9957742e7854bd0a23a3c5add2c96ca","deepnote_cell_height":62,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"Qecw0sKor_Au"},"source":["### 1.3.1 Transformación de notas a \"Nota Chilena\" [0.5 Puntos]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"659f33b2de334546954b0a3f5fce0529","deepnote_cell_height":257.125,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"BfmD-9yi4PnX"},"source":["En una de las reuniones con Don Caguayo este les comenta su intención de pasar todas sus notas a la \"Escala Chilena\".
